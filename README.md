# Text-based Tic Tac Toe Game with Swing GUI
This project is a text-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Swing library. The game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game utilizes the Swing library to provide an interactive and visually appealing GUI.
- Clickable Game Board: The GUI displays a 3x3 grid of buttons representing the game board. Players can make moves by clicking on the buttons.
- Symbol Display: When a player makes a move, X or O symbols are displayed on the corresponding button, providing visual feedback.
- Game Logic: The project includes a separate class to handle the game logic. It keeps track of the current player, the game board, and determines the winner or a tie.
- Winning Conditions: The game correctly identifies winning conditions, such as three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, and declares the corresponding player as the winner.
- Tie Condition: If all cells are filled on the board without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
- Continuous Play: After a game ends, a message dialog box is displayed, and the game can be reset for continuous play without restarting the application.

## Usage
- When the game starts, a window with a 3x3 grid of buttons will appear.
